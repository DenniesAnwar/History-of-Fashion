                    <h2>There's no argument that Raf Simons is lauded as one of the most important designers of all time. His influence on fashion stretches far and wide and there’s little within that realm that he has not conquered. From elevating his own eponymous label to a worldwide cult favorite to wildly successful creative direction stints at Jil Sander and Dior, Raf has found success at nearly every level of the industry.

                        His range as a designer is perhaps what makes him such an inspiring creative force. To date, his collections have done it all, from progressive men's tailoring to subversive, graphic streetwear. 
                    </h2>
                    <h2>
                        His runway shows tends to create an atmosphere that truly capture the essence of each show. His Autumn/Winter 2001 show, "Riot, Riot, Riot" is the epitome of industrial, grungy and atmospheric. 
                        Inspired both in spirit and appearance by the Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers, the show was fittingly presented in an abandoned warehouse. Through the artificially generated fog, 
                        the collection showcased models that were seemingly dressed for an actual riot instead of a runway show. 
                        "Fear Generation" remains one of his Raf Simons' most memorable and impactful works. The collection is a perfect example of how subversion became a keystone of Simons' design, 
                        perfectly capturing the big picture feeling of social unrest and channeling it into the collection's mood and styling.
                        The Spring/Summer 2002's looks are largely monochromatic ones consisting of red, white and black. This gives the collection a "uniform" feeling with many of the models' faces obscured by headscarves. 
                        Graphics and typography embellish key pieces, including a crewneck screen-printed with the slogan “We Are Ready and Willing to Ignite, Just Born Too Late.” The slogan taps into the energy 
                        of youth culture and its willingness to protest the status quo. Most notably, the collection was designed and shown months before the tragic and unfortunate events of 9/11 that would shape 
                        modern geopolitics for years to come and, just like that tragic moment, the clothes remain thematically and aesthetically relevant well over a decade later.
