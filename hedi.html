                    <h2>
                        Fashion designer, photographer, rock star, epitome of man. Hedi Slimane goes by
                        many names, though many in the mainstream might not know him, you can spot a 
                        Hedi Slimane design from the moment you see it. While many designers struggle 
                        to adapt their taste to the fashion marker, Slimane has established his own brand 
                        of signatures, styles, and inspirations all without ever founding a fashion house
                        of his own. By revolutionizing and redefining some of Paris' most coveted <i>maisons,</i>
                        fashion house, his aesthetic reaches far beyond the ateliers of Dior Homme and Yves Saint Laurent.

                        Slimane took spotlight when he took on the role as the head of Dior Homme in 2000.
                        The fashion house's lack of tradition in areas except 'menswear,' allowed Slimane
                        to reshape Dior Homme in his own image, which end up becoming a reoccuring pattern
                        for the houses he will later work for. In 2012 Slimane returned to the fashion world,
                        after departing from Dior in 2006 to follow his passion for photography. Slimane became
                        the prized goat fashion houses were looking for. Yves Saint Laurent hired the French designer
                        and gave him total creative responsibility for the brand image and all of its collections.
                        Within the first year, Slimane dropped the 'Yves' from 'Yves Saint Laurent' to simply
                        'Saint Laurent Paris.'

                    <h2>
                        Now that he took on the position of creative director in C&#233line, history repeats itself
                        and the French designer removed the iconic accent from the e, to simply just 'Celine.'
