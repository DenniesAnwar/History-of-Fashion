                    <h2>The Dark Lord himself, Rick Owens, is a California born European based designer.
                        His eccentri brutalist approach is evident in his fashion, furniture, and even in his personal life.
                    </h2>
                    <h2><i>"Working out is modern couture"</i> Rick Owens proudly advocate in the idea of 
                    dedication and self-improvement. This idea shows through his art, with many of his 
                    pieces often created to show the human figure. Much like Owen's own commitment to his unique 
                    aesthetic and silhoette, his global group of supporters are brand loyal and truly embody
                    and spread Owen's luxurious gothic grunge lifestyle.
                    </h2>

                        His runway shows tends to create an atmosphere that truly capture the essence of each show.
                        While Owen's runway collections earned him justified fame amongst critics and fans alike,
                        it's his footwear that has added to his wider cultural appeal. One of his biggest controvery 
                        and his most iconic piece -- the <i>Dustulator Dunk</i> from Spring/Summer 2006 -- launched him to the mainstream.
                        With Nike sending a cease and desist letter to the company, Owen's seemingly just removed the check
                        on the sneaker while maintaing the silhoette, resulting in one of the most famous sneakers, the Geobasket.
